= Introduction =

This is meant as a short 'how to guide' on how to implement your own custom Source. Be sure to checkout the PacketMultibroadcasterDemo in the downloads since is has several sample implementations.


= Details =

  # Create custom class that will be your Source and make it extend Source
  # In the constructor pass in an 'id' for debugging purposes and the type of Source (audio or video)
  # Override the 'packAudioPacket (!AudioPacket $audioPacket)' or 'packVideoPacket (!VideoPacket $videoPacket)' function with your own implementation on how to pack the packet.
  # If you need additional tie-ins to the framework override 'setupProcessing()', 'beginProcessing()', 'stopProcessing()', and/or 'finalizeProcessing()' but be sure to call the 'super' version of these before you write your implementation for validation purposes.
