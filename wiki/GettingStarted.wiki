#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Getting started with the PacketMultibroadcaster library is meant to be simple for the implementing developer because most of the complication of writing asynchronous code is abstracted to the library itself. Be sure to checkout the PacketMultibroadcasterDemo in the downloads since it is a complete sample implementation of the library.

  # Decide what libraries or what methodology you would like to use to capture and encode media.
  # Follow the other Wikis provided to get instruction on how to implement your own custom Source and Writer.
  # Use the framework class (`PacketMultibroadcaster`) to perform default operations in the library. Such as:
    * Setting up a `SourceGroup` with your custom Sources.
    * Registering Writers to your `SourceGroup(s)`
    * Calling operations on the library. The typical operation order is: `setupProcessing()`, `beginProcessing()`, and (when your ready to stop and finalize the media) `stopProcessing()`
